            <summary>
                Interface that is used to build fluent interfaces and hides methods declared by <see cref="T:System.Object"/> from
                IntelliSense.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                Code that consumes implementations of this interface should expect one of two things:
                <list type="number">
                    <item>
                        When referencing the interface from within the same solution (project reference), you will still see the
                        methods this interface is meant to hide.
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        When referencing the interface through the compiled output assembly (external reference), the standard
                        Object methods will be hidden as intended.
                    </item>
                </list>
                See http://bit.ly/ifluentinterface for more information.
