# release-drafter automatically creates a draft release for you each time you complete a PR in the main branch.
# It uses GitHub labels to categorize changes (See categories) and draft the release.
# release-drafter also generates a version for your release based on GitHub labels. You can add a label of 'major',
# 'minor' or 'patch' to determine which number in the version to increment.
# You may need to add these labels yourself.
# See https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter
