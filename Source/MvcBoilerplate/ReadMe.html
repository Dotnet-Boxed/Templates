                <h3>Security</h3>
                <h4>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> is a great new HTTP header that controls where a web browser is allowed to load content from and the type of content it is allowed to load. It uses a white-list of allowed content and blocks anything not in the allowed list. It gives us very fine grained control and allows us to run our site in a sandbox in the users browser. Learn more about it <a href="http://rehansaeed.co.uk/content-security-policy-for-asp-net-mvc/">here</a>, then Configure your CSP policy globally in FilterConfig.cs or on your individual MVC controllers and actions if they have special access requirements.

                    <li>
                        Modernizr does not currently support
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>
                        because it uses inline CSS styles rather than seperate files. To get around this problem, Inline Styles have been set to allowed in
                        the CSP policy (See FilterConfig.cs). This is not a good practice and reduces some of the security benefits of using it. Keep an eye on
                        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26532234/modernizr-causes-content-security-policy-csp-violation-errors">this</a> StackOverflow

                </ul>
                <h4>Elmah</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Secure the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elmah/">Elmah</a> error log page, so that anonymous users cannot access it. Open the web.config
                        file and look in 'appSettings' for the 'elmah.mvc.allowedRoles' or 'elmah.mvc.allowedUsers' setting. You can set this value to restrict the
                        Elmah page to a role or individual user. Most likely you will have an 'Administrator' role and you can add this to the 'elmah.mvc.allowedRoles'
                        setting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modify the URL used to access the Elmah error log page. This adds security through obscurity. Open the web.config file and you can set the
                        page URL in 'appSettings'. The setting is called 'elmah.mvc.route'. The Elmah error log page is 'http://[YOUR DOMAIN].com/elmah' by default. You can
                        change the value to anything you want. Also, change the elmah route in RouteConfig.cs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>SSL/TLS over HTTPS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> to secure your site so that all requests and responses are made over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>, you should consider using it accross your whole site for best security. SSL/TLS certificates can be obtained for free at <a href="https://www.startssl.com/">StartSSL.com</a>. You can follow <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/09/the-complete-guide-to-loading-free-ssl.html">this</a> guide to setting up SSL/TLS using StartSSL.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open the FilterConfig.cs file and uncomment the line 'filters.Add(new RequireHttpsAttribute());' to use SSL accross the whole site.</li>
                            <li>Open the Global.asax.cs file and uncomment the line 'AntiForgeryConfig.RequireSsl = true;'. This ensures that the Anti-Forgery tokens require SSL to work, which gives a little added security.</li>
                            <li>Open the web.config file and change the requireSSL setting in the httpCookies section to true, to enable cookies to be sent using SSL only by default.</li>
                            <li>Open the Startup.cs file and uncomment the app.UseHsts(options => options.MaxAge(days: 30).IncludeSubdomains().Preload()); line to turn on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security">Strict-Transport-Security</a>.</li>
                            <li>If using Strict-Transport-Security above, submit your domain to the <a href="https://hstspreload.appspot.com/">HSTS Preload</a> site so that your domain can be preloaded using HTTPS rather than HTTP See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security#Preloading_Strict_Transport_Security">this</a> for more information about preloading.</li>
                            <li>Use the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest">SSLLabs.com</a> site to check that you have imlemented SSL/TLS over HTTPS correctly.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Other Security</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you are storing connection strings or a machine key in your Web.config file, don't forget to encrypt them. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dtkwfdky.aspx">this</a> link for more information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scan your site for security vulnerabilities at <a href="https://asafaweb.com/">ASafaWeb.com</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enable <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228298%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396">retail mode</a> in the machine.config file on the production server you are hosting your site on. You can find the file in the locations below:

                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <h4>Caching</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The sitemap.xml, robots.txt, not found error page and unauthorized error page are generated programatically and then cached for a day.
                        If these files won't change much on your site, change the length of time they are cached. Open the web.config file and take a look at the caching section.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/improving-performance-with-output-caching-cs">OutputCache</a> attribute in conjunction with the caching section in the Web.config file to cache pages that don't change often and do not contain sensative information.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Upload the static files to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a> for vastly better performance.
                        examples of static content include your images, minified CSS bundle content, minified JavaScript bundle content, etc. examples on
                        how to do this are shown
                        <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cdn-serve-content-from-cdn-in-your-web-application/">here</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Other Performance</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the size of your images by saving them so that they are as small as possible while still looking good. The quality of JPG's can be reduced for example. Some image applications like PhotoShop have a save for the web feature.</li>
                    <li>
                        Then use the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a56eddd3-d79b-48ac-8c8f-2db06ade77c3/">Image Optimizer</a> Visual Studio extension to compress your images
                        without losing any quality. If you want further better compression, use <a href="http://pnggauntlet.com/">PNG Gauntlet</a> to compress PNG images only.
                        PNG Gauntlet seems to compress PNG images better than other software.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Other Performance</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If running IIS 7.5 or below, disable ETags. Open the web.config file and search for 'setEtag' for further instructions.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you are planning on using ASP.NET Web Forms, open the Global.asax.cs file and remove the two lines of code where we are removing the
                        ASP.NET Web Forms view engine. We do this for added performance but if you are using Web Forms, add it back in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your this site is deployed to a server cluster and you use MVC anti-forgery tokens, generate a machine key from IIS. You can then open
                        the web.config file and uncomment the machineKey element. Paste in your key generated from IIS here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If there are subsequent pages that a user is likely to visit, such as the next link on a gallery page, consider adding prefetch or prerender
                        link tags to the head of the page. See <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/11/07/prebrowsing/">here</a> and

Also consider implementing IE11 <a href="msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/jj883726(v=vs.85).aspx">flip ahead</a>, if you have next and previous buttons.

                    <li>
                        If supporting Android/Chrome M39+, update the /Content/icons/manifest.json file with the name of your site.

                    <li>
                        Default document browsing has been turned off by default for security reasons e.g. Navigating to /Folder/ which contains the physical file index.html,
                        will not return /Folder/index.html. This should not be a problem as we are using ASP.NET MVC controllers and actions. If you do want to
                        use physical files in folders, you may want to turn this feature back on. The security implications of doing this are small.
                        In the Web.config file set &lt;defaultDocument enabled="true"/&gt;.

                <h3>Resilience and Error Handling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Update the static error pages under the Error folder with the name of your application. These particular error pages cannot be dynamically generated because your site is overloaded with requests or is under a denial of service attack. Keep these pages simple and do not make use of any dynamic content which may not be working if these error pages are showing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Update the <a href="http://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/dynamicipsecurity">Dynamic IP Security</a> limits in the dynamicIpSecurity section of the web.config file. This feature of IIS prevents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Denial of Service (DoS)</a> attacks from taking down your site. Dynamic IP Security is currently set to logging only mode, where IIS will log requests from the client that would be rejected without actually rejecting them.. You should run your site in this mode for some time and slowly raise the limits until you get no more 403.501 or 403.502 errors. Normal legitimate requests that can look like a DoS attack are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Google and Bing often make large numbers of requests that can look like a DoS attack and you do not want to block them by accident.</li>
                            <li>Some organizations put themselves behind a proxy and their requests can look like they are from a single IP address.</li>
                            <li>Pages on your site that cause a large number of requests to be made your site may trigger the Dynamic IP Security limits to be triggered and the page loading will be treated like a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</li>
                        </ul>
                        You can test this feature by recording a request to your site using <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> and then replaying it many times.

                        Navigate to {your site}/glimpse and also learn how to use Glimpse <a href="http://getglimpse.com/">here</a>.
                        Install Glimpse extensions e.g. Glimpse.EF6 allows you to see the SQL being executed by Entity Framework.
                        Extensions are as easy as installing NuGet packages listed at <a href="http://getglimpse.com/Extensions">here</a>.
                        Glimpse can also be used to performance tune your application. It records the length of time taken to perform
                        various actions.

                        Edit the humans.txt file at the root of the site. This is totally optional, you can delete this file if you want (If you delete it, remove
                        the line in RouteConfig.cs which ignores the humans.txt route). Be careful what you put into this file, you could give away clues about
                        potential attack vectors on your site. Even giving contact details can be an attack vector (Most hackers manipulate people to get access).

                <h3>Keeping Your Site Up To Date</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most updates can be easily carried out by simply updating <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a> packages. See <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-dialog">this</a> link for more information. However, there are a few things to watch out for before updating a package:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It's worth reading the NuGet package release notes to see what has changed and base the urgency of upgrading on this information. Blindly updating, can sometimes cause things to break. Sometimes packages are incompatible with other packages or there are special upgrade steps that need to be carried out.</li>
                            <li>Check the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/twy1dw1e%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">assemblyBinding</a> section in the web.config file to see if the version of a .dll file needs to be changed to the version you are updating to. This section of the web.config file ensures that interdependent .dll's continue to work with each other, even if a package is expecting an older version of another .dll.</li>
                            <li>When updating JavaScript or CSS framework NuGet Packages, be careful that the particular version you are updating to is also available on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>. Some CDN's update more often than others. This project template uses the popular Google and Microsoft CDN's as it is likely that their scripts are already preloaded in a browsers cache. However, their CDN service also does not update too often. Take a look at the BundleConfig.cs to see which CDN's are being used.</li>
                            <li>You need to ensure that you update your JavaScript and CSS framework NuGet packages when there are new versions to obtain security patches but also because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>'s sometimes retire very old scripts. This template provides fallback scripts, so if a CDN does retire a script or goes down, it will use the scripts in this template instead. This will result in a slight performance degredation.</li>
                            <li>Updating JavaScript or CSS framework NuGet packages causes the new files to be dumped in one folder. To ensure cleanliness of the project, these are then moved to their respective sub-folders.</li>
                            <li>Updating the MVC NuGet packages will cause your site to break entirely and will require changes to your site which are detailed on the <a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET site</a>.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>The ASP.NET MVC Boilerplate project template is constantly improving. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/RehanSaeed/ASP.NET-MVC-Boilerplate/blob/master/Source/MvcBoilerplateVsix/Release%20Notes.txt">release notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RehanSaeed/ASP.NET-MVC-Boilerplate/commits/master">commits</a> to the project and update your site accordingly.</li>
